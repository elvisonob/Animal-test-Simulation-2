<h1>Project Title</h1>
Animal-Zoo-Simulator

<h1>Project Description</h1>
This Application displays three types of Animals in a zoo.
Each zoo compartment contains five of each type of animal.
Each animal starts with an health status of 100%.
After each hour, a random figure between 0 and 20 is generated, and this figure's percentage of the current Animal's health reduces their health status.

Each Animal's health status can also be fed/increased when a User queries the Feed button.

I used create-react-app to execute the project.
