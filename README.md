<h1>Project Title</h1>
<h3>Animal Zoo Simulator<h3>

<h1>Project Description</h1>
This Application displays three types of Animals in a zoo.<br><br>

Each zoo compartment contains five of each type of animal.<br>

Each animal starts with an health status of 100%.<br>

After each hour, a random figure between 0 and 20 is generated, and this figure's percentage of the current Animal's health reduces their health status.

<<<<<<< HEAD
When a monkey has a health status below 30%, it is proclaimed 'Dead'.<br>
When a Giraffe has a health status below 50%, it is proclaimed 'Dead'.<br>
When an Elephant has a health status below 70%, it either 'Can't walk' or 'Dead'<br>

Each Animal's health status can also be fed/increased when a User queries the Feed button.<br>

I used create-react-app to execute the project.
